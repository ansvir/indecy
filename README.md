## Indecy Core

### Description:
The main goal of project - to simplify displaying a business flow sequences in the view of tree (Groovy).
Was created DSL using Groovy and implemented business logic in Java to run custom declared DSL scripts.

There are **three** main components in Indecy:
1. Flow
2. Cases
3. Branches

Flow - aggregation of cases, consider it like business process. Cases - single subprocess that contains business rules - branches.
Generally, `switch` instruction in Java is very similar to logic of Indecy in current version.

**Note**: Currently validation is not implemented, so, you cannot have two regular branches that fit specified condition!
### Sample usage

#### Prerequisites:
1. We have example flow (DSL script): `org/itique/indecy/core/groovy/bonusesFlow.groovy`
2. We have next declaration: 
```java
double startIndex = 1.0;

IndecyFlow flow = IndecyFlow.builder(startIndex)
        .runFlow(new File("myDslScript.groovy"));
System.out.println(flow.getResult().doubleValue());
```

Console output will be `2.3` (after rounding)

### Changelog

Version 1.0-SNAPSHOT

- Developed MVP

### TODO (In order of priority):
1. Migrate to tree data structure
2. Move `org.itique.indecy.core.dsl.FinalCase` to `org.itique.indecy.core.dsl.Case.Option`
3. Add parameters processing
4. Add dynamically branch returned result to parameters
5. Add validation
